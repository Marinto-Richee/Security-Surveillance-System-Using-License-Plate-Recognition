# SECURITY SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM USING LICENSE PLATE RECOGNITION
A project using YoloV8 to detect License Plates
## ABSTRACT
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vehicle number plate recognition system (VNPRS) is an advanced technology that has revolutionized the way vehicles are tracked and monitored. It consists of two main components: a camera that captures the license plate image and a software system that processes the image and recognizes the characters. OCR algorithms use patterns and shapes to create a unique identification number for the vehicle, which can be used for a variety of applications. VNPRS has numerous benefits, such as improved security and safety, increased efficiency in law enforcement, and reduced traffic congestion. It is likely to see more widespread adoption in the near future.

## OBJECTIVE
<p align="justify">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Vehicle Number Plate Recognition (VNPR) system is a technology that automatically recognizes and reads the license plates of vehicles through cameras and software. Its main objectives are to improve road safety, enhance security, and provide efficient traffic management. It can also help in preventing crimes such as car thefts and terrorist activities. Additionally, it can help in enhancing law enforcement by providing crucial information such as the time and location of a crime and the license plate of the vehicle involved. The system has the potential to transform the way we manage our roads and enhance the safety and security of our communities.
